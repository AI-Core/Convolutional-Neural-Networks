    "## What information do neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The fully connected neural network we looked at in the previous lesson takes in a vector input. Thus to process an image we must *flatten* it (stack the rows on top of each other) so that it becomes a vector. When trying to interpret an image, the spatial relations between the different pixels is crucial to our understanding. When we flatten the image, we lose this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do convolutional neural networks use the spacial structure of their inputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks solve this very problem. Rather than performing a matrix multiplication, a convolution operation is performed which can take in a 2d input and give a 2d output hence keep the information about the spatial relations of the pixels. This greatly increases their performance on image and video processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the convolution proccess, you have a filter which you start on the top left side of the image and slide across the whole image, taking a dot product between the values of the filter and pixel values of the image. Bear in mind that colour images have three colour channels so your filter may be 3d so you take the dot product across a 3d volume. Each dot product corresponds to a single activation value in a 2d matrix of neurons which corresponds to a single layer in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/CNN_RGB.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation below shows how a 1x3x3 filter is applied to a 1x5x5 image. Notice how the output has high  values when the filter is passed over locations where there is an X shape in the input image. This is because the values of the filter are such that it is performing pattern matching for the X shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/convolution_animation.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution operations have 3 parameters, the kernel size, which is the width and height of our filter, the stride, which is the number of pixels we translate our kernel by to compute the next feature, and the padding which is how many layers of 0 padding we add to the input image. When the convolution operation is applied, the border pixels are sometimes sampled less than the rest of the pixels when computing features. To counteract this, we add a padding of 0s to the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/CNN_diagram.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each computed feature is a linear function of the pixels in a local region as opposed to fully connected nets where each computed feature is a linear function of all the pixels in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have some prior understanding of how image data should be processed. We apply the same set of weights at different locations all over the image because we know that features are repeated at different locations throughout the image. This makes the learned features translation invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/CNN_FNN_comparison.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time, operations like this were used in computer vision to find different patterns in images with the engineers having to manually tune the values of the filters to perform the required function. The only difference now is that we apply an activation such as Relu or Sigmoid at each layer and after setting up the structure of the network, we initialize the filter values randomly before using gradient descent to automatically tune the values of the filters. We can also apply max pooling operations to subsample the output at each layer therefore reducing the number of parameters that need to be learned for the succeeding convolution operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like before, each successive layer in the network should learn successively higher level abstract features from the inputs."
